# How to build

Gentoo users, you can use my [overlay](https://github.com/tharvik/overlay) to
have some related ebuilds.

You would need
  * `dev-python/odfpy`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/odfpy
    * for python based open document generation
  * `dev-python/toml`: https://github.com/uiri/toml
    * for configuration loading
  * `dev-python/typing`: https://github.com/python/typing
    * if `<dev-lang/python-3.5`, available as standard lib in `dev-lang/python-3.6`
  * `sys-devel/tup`: http://gittup.org/tup/
    * for building
    * very good `make` replacement
    
For optional pdf generation
  * `app-office/libreoffice || app-office/libreoffice-bin`: https://www.libreoffice.org
  * `app-text/poppler`: https://poppler.freedesktop.org/
    * for cleaning empty pages generated by libreoffice

For optional program typechecking
  * `dev-python/mypy`: http://www.mypy-lang.org/

Then, simply go in the sources, type `tup -k` and wait for the generated files.
